I am a dynamic third-year Software Engineering student at McGill University with a passion for innovation. My diverse skill set includes proficiency in Java, Python, C, Javascript, HTML, and Bash, along with experience in Git/Github, Unix/Linux, UML, and PostgreSQL. I thrive in collaborative environments and have honed essential soft skills through tutoring, customer experience work, and leadership roles. Driven by curiosity, I am eager to make a profound impact and add value to any team I join.
